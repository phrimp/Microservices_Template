# Core Components

This page provides detailed information about the core components of our microservice architecture. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring a robust, scalable, and maintainable system.

## Consul: Service Discovery and Distributed Configuration

Consul serves as the backbone of our microservice architecture, providing:

### Key Features
- **Service Discovery**: Enables microservices to find and communicate with each other without hardcoded addresses
- **Health Checking**: Continuously monitors service health to ensure availability and facilitate failover
- **Key-Value Store**: Centralized configuration storage that all services can access
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Allows real-time updates to service configurations without restarts
- **DNS-based Service Discovery**: Services can be discovered via simple DNS queries
- **Service Mesh Capabilities**: Provides a foundation for advanced service-to-service communication patterns

### Implementation
- Maintains the service registry for all microservices
- Stores Traefik's dynamic configurations including middleware definitions
- Provides health status information for all registered services
- Enables dynamic reconfiguration of the entire system
- Acts as the source of truth for service locations and configurations

## Traefik: Modern API Gateway and Edge Router

Traefik functions as the entry point and traffic manager for the system:

### Key Features
- **Automatic Service Discovery**: Integrates with Consul to dynamically discover backend services
- **Middleware Pipeline**: Processes requests through configurable middleware chains
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Updates routing rules on-the-fly without restarts
- **Let's Encrypt Integration**: Automatic SSL certificate provisioning and renewal
- **Circuit Breaking**: Prevents cascading failures across services
- **Request Routing**: Directs traffic to appropriate services based on paths, headers, and other criteria

### Implementation
- Routes external client requests to appropriate internal microservices
- Applies middleware for security, rate limiting, and request modification
- Handles SSL termination for secure communication
- Provides load balancing across service instances
- Exposes a dashboard for monitoring and troubleshooting
- Fetches configuration dynamically from Consul

## HashiCorp Vault: Secret Management and Security

Vault provides enterprise-grade security features for the microservice ecosystem:

### Key Features
- **Secure Secret Storage**: Centralized repository for all sensitive information
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Generate temporary credentials with automatic expiration
- **Encryption as a Service**: Provide encryption capabilities without exposing keys
- **Identity-based Access**: Fine-grained control over who can access which secrets
- **Credential Rotation**: Automatic rotation of credentials to enhance security
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logs of all secret access attempts

### Implementation
- Securely stores API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information
- Provides dynamic access credentials to services based on their identity
- Implements the AppRole auth method for service-to-service authentication
- Maintains policies that control which services can access which secrets
- Uses Consul as its storage backend for high availability
- Automates the loading of secrets from configuration files

## Docker & Docker Compose: Containerization and Orchestration

### Docker
- **Purpose**: Application containerization
- **Benefits**:
  - Consistent environments across development, testing, and production

### Docker Compose
- **Purpose**: Multi-container orchestration
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplified container management
  - Declarative service configuration
  - Easy local development setup
  - Service dependency management
- **Health Checks**:
  - Built-in health check capability (`healthcheck` directive)
  - Configurable test commands, intervals, and timeouts
  - Integration with service dependency management
  - Supports marking containers as unhealthy based on criteria

## Optional Components
